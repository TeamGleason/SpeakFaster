# Phase I Hypothesis

By combining a series of technologies, each of which contribute 10-30% improvement to outcomes, we can demonstrate an overall improvement of 200% effective speech output.

## Specific Aim 1

Develop an observation and measurement system which facilitates the collection of repeatable, hard scientific measurements of AAC outcomes for existing AAC software.

#### Milestone

Observation system can record and upload raw data consisting of screen captures, eye gaze movements, AAC output, and contextual audio streams.  Semi-automated signals processing can analyze these data streams and output typing, errors, speech generation, outcome metrics, and time stamp correlate this with conversational context. 

## Specific Aim 2

Develop an open source experimental AAC application that works with an eye tracker that can be used for deeper instrumentation and experimentation.

#### Milestone

Experimental AAC application can achieve equivalent outcomes to existing AAC software.

## Specific Aim 3

Perform experiments with language modeling, enhanced prediction context, in-place editing, and plan-ahead conversations.

#### Milestone

Analyze outcomes for each individual experiment.  Analyze outcomes for combined improvements.

# Expected Outcomes

Find four technology improvements with an average 20% improvement in speech outcomes, which works out to an estimated 107% overall improvement.
