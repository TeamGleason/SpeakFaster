# Assuming that eye gaze activation faster than 300ms is faster than realistically possible.
# This is useful for detecting automatic insertion of characters as opposed to manually typed
# characters. A prime example is when predictions are used. A rapid series of backspace keys
# followed by rapid typing of characters
mingazetime = datetime.timedelta(milliseconds=300)

# Phase 1:
# 
# Raw: Characters, Space Delimited, Other Ctrl/Alt Modifiers (Ctl-, Alt-)
# Char Analysis: Speak, Stop, Pause, Enter, Backspace, Count of Characters Spoken
# Timing Analysis: Backword, Use Prediction, WPM
# Context Analysis: STX, ETX, CAN
# 
# ETX is inserted when detecting Speak, Stop, or Cancel.
# Cancel is detected if after STX, CTRL-A is received before Speak.
# When STX ... Stop/Pause ... Speak is detected, WPM timings are not calculated.

# Example Output:
# 
# ␂ H E L K 🠠 L O ␃ 💬 ⏲12.3
# ␂ H E L 🗩HELLO ␃ 💬 ⏲16.3
# 🗪 { Speak : 2 , Characters : 10, AverageWPM : 14.3 , TopWPM : 16.3 }
